Session 12 & 13 (Maven)
Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.
It simplifies the build process like ANT. But it is too much advanced than ANT.

What is Build Tool
A build tool takes care of everything for building a process. It does following:
o	Generates source code (if auto-generated code is used)
o	Generates documentation from source code
o	Compiles source code
o	Packages compiled code into JAR of ZIP file
o	Installs the packaged code in local repository, server repository, or central repository
Understanding the problem without Maven
There are many problems that we face during the project development. They are discussed below:
1) Adding set of Jars in each project: In case of struts, spring, hibernate frameworks, we need to add set of jar files in each project. It must include all the dependencies of jars also.
2) Creating the right project structure: We must create the right project structure in servlet, struts etc, otherwise it will not be executed.
3) Building and Deploying the project: We must have to build and deploy the project so that it may work.
